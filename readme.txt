This assignment is developed by PyCharm through Github in python language.

All the time of algorithm gets from the environment of:
    AMD Ryzen 5 z600 six-core processor
    16G memory

Run the program:

First, put all three puzzle files(grid8x8.txt, grid10x10.txt, grid14x14.txt) into the same directory of main.py.

Then run main.py(type python .\main.py in command line and hit Enter), the result will show in the console as well as in GUI. After one puzzle is finished, the GUI will pop out.
Close the GUI to continue to solve the next puzzle. If there is no solution for the current puzzle, the GUI will not show.

If the puzzle takes more than 600 seconds and still running, it will be killed. Please remember the time GUI display will also count in the total running time of the process. This will cause an abort from the process when the running time plus GUI display time reaches 10 minutes.
