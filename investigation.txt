cost_of_fc(time/nodes)=forward_checking_h1+forward_checking_h2+forward_checking_hybrid
cost_of_bt(time/nodes)=back_track_h1+back_track_h2+back_track_hybrid
percentage=(cost_of_bt - cost_of_fc) / cost_of_fc
percentage shows how many times the backtrack algorithm is slower than forward checking


Overall, forward checking has much faster speed than the backtrack. It is forward checking can great remove a lot of position in the map such that it can reduce the search space. Heuristic 1 is better than heuristic 2 in average, and hybrid heuristic is the most stable one. Forward checking with hybrid(H3) has best performance in average.
